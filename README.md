# Orcheeseo
(Fall 2020)<br>This project mainly focuses on strings and logic, taking in an inputted string combination of o's (Oreos), c's (Creme), and g's (Goldfish), an Orcheeseo, and outputting whether said Orcheeseo is a good or bad Orcheeseo, or even if it is not one even. Each layer has it's own respective height and should the creation be taller than 4, it is too tall.
